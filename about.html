    <h2>üéØ What is LF Attribute Forge?</h2>
    <p>LF Attribute Forge is a Unity editor based wizard tool designed to eliminate the tedious boilerplate code that
      comes
      with creating RPG and a lot of other game attribute systems. Instead of manually writing hundreds of lines of
      repetitive code for
      health, mana, stats, and other game attributes, you can generate complete, production-ready systems in minutes.
    </p>

    <div class="feature-grid">
      <div class="feature-card">
        <h4>The Problem</h4>
        <p>Every RPG or stat-based game needs attributes like Health, Mana, Strength, etc. Implementing these manually
          means:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Writing repetitive getter/setter code</li>
          <li>Creating UI binding systems</li>
          <li>Implementing regeneration logic</li>
          <li>Adding validation and events</li>
          <li>Hours of boilerplate coding</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="feature-card">
        <h4>The Solution</h4>
        <p>LF Attribute Forge automates all of this:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>4-step wizard interface</li>
          <li>Complete code generation</li>
          <li>Built-in UI binding system</li>
          <li>Performance optimizations</li>
          <li>Professional validation</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>üë§ Created by Living Failure</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Living Failure, an indie game develope. I
      handle everything from programming gameplay systems to designing and animating 2D and 3D assets.</p>
    <h3>Why I Built This Tool</h3>
    <p>After working on multiple RPG and strategy games, I found myself constantly recreating the same attribute
      systems. Every project needed health, mana, stats, and the associated UI systems. The code was always similar but
      never quite the same, so I couldn't just copy-paste between projects.</p>

    <p>I realized that what the Unity community needed wasn't another asset store plugin with pre-built components, but
      a <strong>code generation wizard tool</strong> that could create custom attribute systems tailored to each
      project's
      specific needs in a generic way.</p>

    <h3>Design Philosophy</h3>
    <div class="feature-grid">
      <div class="feature-card">
        <h4>Generate, Don't Package</h4>
        <p>Instead of giving you pre-built components, LF Attribute Forge generates clean, readable code that becomes
          part of your project. You own it, you can modify it, and you understand exactly how it works.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="feature-card">
        <h4>Performance First</h4>
        <p>The generated code is optimized for performance with cached lookups, dirty checking, and efficient memory
          usage. No runtime overhead from heavy frameworks.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="feature-card">
        <h4>Developer Experience</h4>
        <p>The tool should be intuitive enough for beginners but powerful enough for experienced developers. Clear
          validation, helpful error messages, and comprehensive documentation.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>üöÄ Development Journey</h2>
    <p>LF Attribute Forge started as a personal tool to speed up my own game development. After using it successfully in
      several projects, I decided to polish it and share it with the Unity community.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>üéÆ Free vs Pro Philosophy</h2>
    <p>I believe that core game development tools should be accessible to everyone, which is why the free version of LF
      Attribute Forge includes everything you need to build professional attribute systems.</p>

    <div class="feature-grid">
      <div class="feature-card">
        <h4>Free Version</h4>
        <p>Contains all essential features:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Complete attribute wizard</li>
          <li>Full code generation</li>
          <li>UI binding system</li>
          <li>Performance optimizations</li>
          <li>Documentation and support</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="feature-card">
        <h4>Pro Version</h4>
        <p>Adds advanced features for complex projects:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Advanced modifier system</li>
          <li>Attribute influence chains</li>
          <li>Conditional modifiers</li>
          <li>Runtime debug tools</li>
          <li>Priority support</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>The free version is not a "trial" or "demo" - it's a complete tool that many developers will never need to
      upgrade from. The Pro version exists for developers working on complex RPG systems who need advanced modifier
      mechanics.</p>
